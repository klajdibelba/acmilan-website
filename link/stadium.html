      Milan played their first matches at the Trotter pitch, located where the
      Milan Central railway station would later be built. It could not be
      defined as a stadium, as there were no dressing rooms, no stands and no
      other facilities. In 1903, Milan moved to the Acquabella pitch, where the
      stands consisted of a section of ground raised for the purpose. Milan
      played there until 1905. The following year the club moved to the Porta
      Monforte pitch, where they played until 1914. The stadium was furnished
      with a ticket office and wooden stands. In the following years Milan
      played at the Velodromo Sempione from 1914 to 1920, and at the Viale
      Lombardia stadium from 1920 to 1926. The latter was a modern structure,
      with a big main stand and which hosted several games of the Italy national
      football team.[81] In 1926 Milan moved to the stadium where they still
      play nowadays: The San Siro. The stadium,[15] officially known as Stadio
      Giuseppe Meazza after the former player who represented both Milan and
      Internazionale, has 75,923 seats. The more commonly used name, "San Siro",
      is the name of the district where it is located. San Siro was privately
      built by funding from Milan's president at the time, Piero Pirelli.
      Construction was performed by 120 workers, and took 13+1⁄2 months to
      complete. The stadium was owned by the club until it was sold to the city
      in 1935, and since 1947 it has been shared with Internazionale when the
      other major Milanese club was accepted as joint tenant. The first game
      played at the stadium was on 19 September 1926, when Milan lost 6–3 in a
      friendly match against Internazionale. Milan played its first league game
      in San Siro on 19 September 1926, losing 1–2 to Sampierdarenese. From an
      initial capacity of 35,000 spectators, the stadium has undergone several
      major renovations, most recently in preparation for the 1990 FIFA World
      Cup when its capacity was set to 85,700, all covered with a polycarbonate
      roof. In the summer of 2008 its capacity was reduced to 80,018, to meet
      the new standards set by UEFA. Based on the English model for stadiums,
      San Siro is specifically designed for football matches, as opposed to many
      multi-purpose stadiums used in Serie A. It is therefore renowned in Italy
      for its fantastic atmosphere during matches, largely thanks to the
      closeness of the stands to the pitch. The frequent use of flares by
      supporters contributes to the atmosphere but the practice has occasionally
      caused problems. On 19 December 2005, Milan vice-president and executive
      director Adriano Galliani announced that the club was seriously working
      towards a relocation. He stated Milan's new stadium will be largely based
      on the Veltins-Arena – the home of Schalke 04 in Gelsenkirchen – and will
      follow the standards of football stadiums in the United States, Germany
      and Spain. As opposed to many other stadiums in Italy, Milan's new stadium
      would likely be used for football only, having no athletics track. On 11
      December 2014, Barbara Berlusconi announced a proposal to build a property
      stadium of 42,000 seats in Portello, behind the new HQ of the Rossoneri,
      and the large square "Piazza Gino Valle". The new village with shopping
      malls and hotel is located near CityLife district and is served by the
      metro.[82] On 20 September 2015, however, Silvio Berlusconi called an end
      to his club's plans to build a new stadium in the city.[83] In 2017, new
      CEO Marco Fassone stated that the club may look at either staying in the
      San Siro or moving to a new stadium with the club hierarchy emphasising
      the need to increase average attendance for home games.[84]
