      Associazione Calcio Milan (Italian pronunciation: [assotʃatˈtsjoːne
      ˈkaltʃo ˈmiːlan]), commonly referred to as AC Milan (Italian
      pronunciation: [a ˈtʃi ˈmiːlan]) or simply Milan (Italian pronunciation:
      [miːlan]),[6] is a professional football club based in Milan, Italy.
      Founded in 1899, the club competes in the Serie A, the top tier of Italian
      football, and has spent its entire history there with the exception of the
      1980–81 and 1982–83 seasons.[7][8] Domestically, AC Milan has won 19
      league titles, making it the second most successful club in the Serie A
      together with city rivals Inter Milan.[9] The club has also won 5 Coppa
      Italia titles and 7 Supercoppa Italiana titles.[10] In international
      competitions, Milan's 18 FIFA and UEFA trophies is the fourth highest out
      of any club in the world (joint with Boca Juniors[nb 1]), and the most out
      of any Italian club.[10][11][12][13] Milan has won seven European
      Cup/Champions League titles, a joint record[nb 2] five UEFA Super Cups,
      two UEFA Cup Winners' Cups, a joint record[nb 3] three Intercontinental
      Cups and one FIFA Club World Cup.[10] In its early history, Milan played
      its home games in different grounds around the city before moving to its
      current stadium, the San Siro, in 1926. The stadium, which was built by
      Milan's second chairman Piero Pirelli and is shared with city rivals Inter
      since 1947,[14] is the largest in Italian football, with a total capacity
      of 75,817.[15] They have a long-standing rivalry with Inter, with whom
      they contest the Derby della Madonnina, one of the most followed derbies
      in football.[16] The club is one of the wealthiest in Italian and world
      football.[17] It was a founding member of the now-defunct G-14 group of
      Europe's leading football clubs as well as its replacement, the European
      Club Association.[18]
